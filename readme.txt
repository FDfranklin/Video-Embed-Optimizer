Greatly increases your page speed while embedding a YouTube or Vimeo video. Automatically makes videos 100% responsive.

== Description ==

Video Embed Optimizer is all about pure performance and fully responsive video embeds. Most users will embed a YouTube or Vimeo video without realizing it slows down their website. The slowness comes from the "ready to play" player loaded by embedding YouTube of Vimeo videos using their suggested iframe embed. With multiple videos or even one on your webpage, you could be significantly reducing the page load time. In a side by side test using GTMetrix, Video Embed Optimizer saved 602KB off of the page size as well as increased the page load time by 5 milliseconds.
